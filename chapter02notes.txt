Cumulative distibution is a formula that seems straightforward to code

But straightforward algorithm is impractical
	- huge inetermediate factorial values
	- "fail fast" approach

Creating custom operators
	- should be used with care and restraint

Aliasing functions locally
	- greater conciseness

NUnit and FsUnit 
	- tests 
	- equalWithin
	- test cases generation in Excel and pasting into the code
